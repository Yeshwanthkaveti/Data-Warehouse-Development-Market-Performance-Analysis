# Database Layered Architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold
This repository contains SQL code for implementing a database architecture with three distinct layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. These layers follow the medallion architecture pattern commonly used in data engineering pipelines. The code focuses on data transformation and analysis, moving data from raw sources through intermediate processing (Silver) to a refined, analytical structure (Gold) for reporting and decision-making purposes.

## Layers Overview
### 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
The Bronze layer contains raw, unprocessed data directly imported from the source systems. It serves as the foundation for further cleaning and transformation, with the data being largely unchanged and in its most granular form.

Purpose: Store raw data to be cleaned and transformed in the next stages.

### 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Transformed Data)
The Silver layer involves data processing and transformation. Data from the Bronze layer is cleaned, filtered, and enhanced with basic transformations, ensuring it is suitable for analysis. This layer may also include preliminary aggregations and simple join operations.

Purpose: Clean and transform the raw data, making it usable for analytical purposes.

### 3. Gold Layer (Analytical Data)
The Gold layer contains the most refined version of the data, designed for reporting and analysis. It aggregates and joins data from the Silver layer to create structured datasets for business intelligence, dashboards, and detailed analysis. Views and complex queries are defined to generate key metrics, trends, and insights for stakeholders.

Purpose: Provide refined and structured datasets for generating reports and insights.

## Project Structure
The SQL code is organized into different layers:

Bronze Layer SQL: Raw data loading and basic transformation.

Silver Layer SQL: Data cleaning, filtering, and preliminary transformations.

Gold Layer SQL: Advanced aggregations, business metrics, and analytical views.

#### Additionally, the project includes various SQL queries for:

Data exploration and analysis (e.g., date ranges, customer demographics).

Business metrics analysis (e.g., total sales, product performance).

Trend and performance analysis over time (e.g., comparing sales, revenue trends).

Reporting views for customer-level insights (e.g., sales performance, average order value).
